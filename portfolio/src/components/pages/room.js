                    I play the clarinet, the bass clarinet, the soprano saxophone, and the tenor saxophone. 
                    Clarinet was the first woodwind instrument I started with, and I loved it; hence, I still play it after 9 years. 
                    During the years, soprano and tenor saxophones were added to my list, the Bb family! 
                    I first tried the tenor saxophone, and it was difference from the clarinet. 
                    Since then, I kept playing and eventually started playing the soprano saxophone. 
                    My time at Halifax Grammar School, a huge part of it was the bands. 
                    I was a member of Senior Band, Wind Emsemble, Senior Jazz Band, and a few more. 
                    In my last few years there, I was a member of pit band for school musicals. 
                    That is when I played all 4 woodwinds, which was not easy.

                    I got my hands on a ukulele back when I was in 8th grade. 
                    Since then, I have been playing for years and picked up a guitar a few years ago. 
                    I used to play the piano and the violin back when I was very little in Korea and I remember almost nothing, 
                    though I would be very happy to re-learn!
